# Bonfire 2

Just getting started. More details at [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lonnieezell)

## What is Bonfire?

Bonfire will be a robust application skeleton for CodeIgniter 4-based applications. It provides a number of helpful
libraries to assist you in making better software for your clients, faster, while allowing you to focus on the 
new parts that matter to each specific application. 

Currently includes the following features: 
- Theme/template system, that ships with a flexible Auth and Admin theme.
- View Components to reduce the complexity of your UI by allowing you to create reusable HTML snippets, that can be optionally controlled via code.
- A Settings library that allows you to save config file values to the database and access them whether they're in the db or just in the files. 
- Resource Filter system to make filtering lists of User, Post, etc, simple to implement and with a comfortable, consistent UI.
- A powerful, very customizable, user authentication/authorization system, [Shield](https://github.com/lonnieezell/codigniter-shield).
- and more to come... 

## Server Requirements

This currently has the same requirements as CodeIgniter 4.

## Third Party Software Used

- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the CSS foundation
- [FontAwesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) icons used in the admin 
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) handles interactivity within the page for the admin area.
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/) provides AJAX form handling, and more.
- [Tatter/Alerts](https://github.com/tattersoftware/codeigniter4-alerts) CodeIgniter library for simple user alerts.
